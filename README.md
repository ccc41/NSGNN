# Probing Negative Sampling for Contrastive Learning to Learn Graph Representations
This is the code for our ECML-PKDD 2021 paper "[Probing Negative Sampling for Contrastive Learning to Learn Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06317)", which is the first proposals of node-wise contrastive learning to graph data embedding. We also address the class collision problem of the contrastive learning and distorted results caused by imbalanced distribution of the dataset.
